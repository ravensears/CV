## STAR
- During our Acebook Challenge, which was a two week group project, our cohort was expected to implement CI/CD during this challenge. 
- We used GitHub Actions and Heroku to achieve this, but many found the deployment initialisation and debugging incredibly difficult.
- As I quickly understood the concept and functioning, I volunteered to help the groups get their Heroku working. I worked with the groups to explain how to setup their accounts, what to look for in their build logs for debugging, and the commands that would display this on the CL.
- Everyone was able to get their projects deployed and operating, without me missing valuable time from my own group project.
